# VisualGo 

Welcome to Visualgo(Algorithm Visualizer) I built this web application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. This is an academic project in Software Engineering Course in 2nd year of my degree. I built this web application under the able guidence of my instructor Mr. Syed Ahmed Usman. I hope that this application helps students in understanding the working mechanism of different sorting algorithms and in consolidating their concepts about these algorithms as it is expected from every computer engineering student.
